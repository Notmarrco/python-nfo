# Description
This library is intended to cover the XML NFO format as used by the Kodi project.

# To Do
* Parsing - currently only generates the XML.
* Fully implement all the complex node types.

# Background
All I really wanted was to have hacker conference talks show up with some info in Kodi not just the filename.
Then I did one of these <https://xkcd.com/974/>. Now I can pass arbitrary NFO condiments.

# Reference
* <http://kodi.wiki/view/Video_management>
* Export of my existing library
